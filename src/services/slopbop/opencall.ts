// The open call — the lifecycle both crowdsourced collection types run on. A

// and released one at a time. A jam and a mixtape differ only at the end of it,

//
// Returned as `open_call_status` (was `jam_status`, and jam-only) on collection
// detail, `jams/current`, the jam standings read, and the 409s from create and
// resolve.

// Where an open call is in its life. Derived server-side from the clock, never
// stored. Not the same question as `RequestStatus.open`: that's "can I submit
// right now", this is where the event has got to. One that filled early is shut
// to submissions while still in its `open` phase.

  // `release_date`s — `SongList`'s countdown-card path.
