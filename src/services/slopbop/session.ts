/**
 * **The signed-in user. One copy, app-wide.**
 *
 * Everything about who the caller is lives here and nowhere else: the bearer
 * token, the user they are, the artists they control, and whether a sign-in is
 * in flight. `apiFetch` reads the token from here; React reads the rest from
 * here through `useSyncExternalStore`. Nothing mirrors it into component state,
 * which is the whole point — a mirrored copy is a copy that can disagree.
 *
 * It's an observable rather than a context so that non-React code (the fetch
 * layer) and React can share one truth. Mutating it notifies both.
 *
 * ── The model ──
 * A **user** is anyone who proved a wallet. Their `user_id` *is* that public
 * key. Controlling an artist is a separate fact layered on top: `artists` is
 * usually empty, and an empty list is an ordinary audience account, not a
 * half-finished login. Treat `userId !== null` as "signed in" and never
 * `artists.length > 0`.
 *
 * This file holds state and performs no I/O — the challenge/sign/verify flow
 * that fills it lives in `auth.ts`, which is allowed to import this. Keeping the
 * dependency one-way is what stops `client.ts` and `auth.ts` forming a cycle.
