// How a collection resolves its songs and which extra fields it carries. All
// three resolve their songs by collection_id back-reference and carry the same
// shape; what separates them is how the songs get there:
//
//   album    authored by the artist alone. Not crowdsourced, but it fills the
//            same way: the owner posts tracks one at a time until it's full,
//            then releases it. So detail does return a `request_status` — it
//            just comes back with `submitters: 'owner'`, which is the whole of
//            how the submission path knows to treat it differently. Nothing
//            branches on the type for that. The permanent catalogue (see
//            Discography); `albums.ts` has the three writes only the owner can
//            make.
//   mixtape  crowdsourced against a submission window — what a Mixtape
//            Commission produces.
//   jam      crowdsourced too, capped by capacity as well as by the clock, and
//            at the end the most-bopped song is promoted to a Single and the
//            rest are deleted. The jam doc survives its own resolution, since
//            numbering the next one counts the ones that came before.
//
// The crowdsourced two run the *same* lifecycle — an open call, a window then a
// staggered release. `OpenCallStatus` (`./opencall`) is it, and both carry one.
//
// The union is also the seam for future kinds (e.g. a `playlist` that resolves
// an explicit song_id list instead).

 *
 *   anyone  the crowdsourced types. Everyone may submit, so which of the two
 *           doors gets used is a question about the *session* alone.
 *   owner   the owning artist. Everyone else is refused with a 403, signed in
 *           or not, and the anonymous door refuses even them.
 *
 * It travels as data rather than being inferred from `type` on purpose: the rule
 * is the backend's, so a policy change — a restricted mixtape, say — arrives on
 * its own instead of needing a matching `if` here that nobody remembers to write.
