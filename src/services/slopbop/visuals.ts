 *   /slopbop/images         what came back: drafts (unsaved, 24h) and images
 *                           (saved to Arweave, permanent)
 *
 * There is no status endpoint for an order. Orders are disposable — the studio
 * files what it produces as a draft and the order is swept — so "has it landed?"
 * is answered by the drafts list growing, which is what `useImageStudio` polls
 * for. A render that *fails* therefore never appears anywhere; the hook gives up
 * on a timer rather than waiting on a signal that isn't coming.
 *
 * Every call is owner-gated: 403 means this wallet doesn't manage that artist.
 * `apiFetch` attaches the bearer token and handles 401 centrally.

 * its default. Everything an owner makes is the same shape until there's a
 * reason for it not to be, so there's no aspect to pass or to get wrong.

 * the two coming apart: a client that deleted first and then failed to order
 * would have thrown a draft away for nothing.
