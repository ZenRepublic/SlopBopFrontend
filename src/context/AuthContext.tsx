/**
 * The signed-in user, as React sees it.
 *
 * This is a **view onto the session store**, not a second copy of it — the state
 * below is read with `useSyncExternalStore`, so the fetch layer and the UI are
 * looking at the same object. Signing out from a 401 deep inside `apiFetch`
 * re-renders every consumer here without anything having to be told.
 *
 * ── User vs artist ──
 * `isAuthed` means a wallet was proved. That's it, and it's the only thing that
 * should gate "are you allowed to act at all". `artists` — the artists this user
 * controls — is a **separate** fact and is usually empty: most signed-in users
 * are audience. Gating anything on `artists.length` turns an ordinary account
 * into a broken one, which is exactly the bug this replaced.
 *
 * What this deliberately does *not* do is decide whether you own the artist
 * you're looking at. That answer is `is_owner` on the artist's own fetch, so the
 * server stays the one place that decides, rather than the client comparing an
 * owner id against a key it also controls.
