// Command-shaped mutation hook: POST a song request and surface the result.
// `fieldErrors` maps payload field names → messages from a 400; map them onto
// inputs. A 404 / 500 / network error rejects — callers should show a generic
// retry.
//
// Which of the two doors it posts through is decided here, from the collection's
// declared `submitters` and the session — never by the caller, so the form and
// the request can't disagree about who's submitting:
//
//   submitters: 'owner'   always signed. The anonymous door can't prove the
//                         artist is the artist, so it 403s even for them.
//   submitters: 'anyone'  signed if there's a session, anonymous otherwise. The
//                         typed name is dropped when signed in — the account is
//                         the credit.
//
// That one line is the whole reason an album needs no submit hook of its own: an
// album is a collection whose door admits one person, which is a value, not a
// separate code path.
//
// `forbidden` is still a real outcome and callers should handle it. `submitters`
// gates the *form* on ownership the viewer claims; this is the server's answer
// about the wallet, arriving late — a signed-in fan who reaches an album's door
// lands here.
