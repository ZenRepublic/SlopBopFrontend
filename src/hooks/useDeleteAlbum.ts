 * *before* it, in a confirm dialog. This hook does not confirm anything.
 *
 * It's also the only exit from a stuck album, and so the only way to start a
 * different one: while an unfinished album exists, creating another 409s.
 *
 * The in-flight guard matters more here than elsewhere. A second delete would
 * 404 rather than destroy anything extra, but it would report as a failure for
