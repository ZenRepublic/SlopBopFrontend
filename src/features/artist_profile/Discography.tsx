//   Community  mixtapes: a commissioned group's artifact from their own day.
//              Filing someone's birthday party under the label's discography
//              would misread it, so it lives behind its own tab — a holding
//              place while we work out how to make mixtapes truly ephemeral.
//              Also the singles a fan wrote: a jam winner is promoted by having
//              its `collection_id` cleared, so nothing but `created_by` would
//              tell it apart from a single the artist wrote.
//
// Jams are absent from both: a live session is not a release. One surfaces as
// the LIVE card at the top of the profile and is gone once it resolves.
//
// Singles are derived, not fetched: any song without a `collection_id`. Songs
// that belong to an album, mixtape, or jam all carry one, so they never fall
// through to singles. Which HALF a single lands in is derived too, from whether
// its `created_by` is the artist's owner. Collection-bound songs need no such
// test — the shelf they sit on already says which side they're on.
