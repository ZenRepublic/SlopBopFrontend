          Your chosen artist has a custom voice, personality, appearance and music taste. With you as
          authors of the lyrics, they can produce a cohesive mixtape that encapsulates the vibe and

          down by the carousel: the interactive blocks are the page's visual
          breaks, so they're spread across the prose rather than stacked.

          The lines underneath are the bonding pitch, and this is the one place
          they land without being a claim: you've just heard what a track sounds
          like, so the mixtape is already real by the time they say what it does
          for the group. */}
