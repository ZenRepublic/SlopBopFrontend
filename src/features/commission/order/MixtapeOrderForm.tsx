/**
 * The ordering surface — everything after the pitch stops.
 *
 * It owns its own ground: the flat fill runs from the top of this section to
 * the bottom of the page, so crossing into it reads as "done reading, now
 * ordering". The fill has to live in here because the section is its containing
 * block, and that's the point — the mood change belongs to the act of ordering,
 * not to the page that happens to host it.
 *
 * Choosing an artist and making the ask are one act, so they're one component:
 * the carousel's selection feeds straight into what gets sent, with no page in
 * between holding the state.
 *
 * Today the ask is an email (ContactForm -> mailto:). When it becomes a real
 * ordering flow — Stripe, a booking calendar — only the piece below the
 * carousel changes; the framing, the selection and the fill stay, and
 * CommissionPage never learns about it.
